It seems that another feedreading project is recognising XOXO!  According to <a href="http://bulknews.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/plagger_update_.html">this post</a> <a href="http://plagger.org/">Plagger</a> has, if I understand correctly, added the ability to import subscriptions from an XOXO reading list and also to export that as OPML.  Not recognising XOXO enough to provide an export mechanism for it yet, but a step forward nevertheless!
