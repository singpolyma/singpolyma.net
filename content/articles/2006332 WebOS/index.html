Whoever first came up with the idea of WebOS was a genius.  Somehow I doubt it started with <a href="http://blog.topix.net/archives/000016.html">Google OS</a>, but my own interest certainly started there.
<span class="on" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"></span>
Soon there was <a href="http://yubnub.org/">YubNub</a>, the command line for the web.  A flexible, open command-line system for the Internet that is practical as well as cool.  A <a href="http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=scrape">backbone</a> kind of application while also being immediately <a href="http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=g">useful</a> to users.

Webtops started popping up, such as those provided by <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30boxes</a> and <a href="http://goowy.com/">Goowy</a>.  They allow you to integrate the major services you use into one convenient location, sort of like an extension of the idea behind <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google IG</a>, <a href="http://boxtheweb.4x2.net/">BoxtheWeb</a>, and others.

Now we have at least two genuine WebOS: <a href="http://www.youos.com/">YouOS</a> and <a href="http://eyeos.org/">EyeOS</a>.  Both provide their own 'standard' way to code apps, with APIs etc to help in GUI and back end building.  YouOS allows developers to code and share apps on the public server, as well as allowing users to install these apps.  EyeOS requires you set up your own server to install apps, but allows apps to be distributed in an offline format.  There are distinct pros and cons to both, and to the APIs provided by both.

WebOS is where it's at, with YubNub, YouOS, and EyeOS.  Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.  However, if we want to see true Web 2.0 here we must not repeat the mistake that was made with offline OS.  WebOS communities/developers <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> work together for standards and interoperability, etc.  Each will be so much better if it works with the strength of the others.
