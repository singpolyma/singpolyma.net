<b title="Update 2006-12-21">If you don't use del.icio.us and want more posts showing up in your calendar try appending ?max-results=999 to your feed URL.  So it will look like:
http://<span style="color:red;">yourblog</span>.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/full?max-results=999
</b>

So you're not satisfied with just an archive list?  You've perhaps switched to BETA and even the hierarchal menu just isn't cool enough?  Well, you've come to the right place.

This hack allows you to generate a calendar of your posts for people to browse <span style="font-style: italic;">inline in your blog</span>!  This hack works with either Blogger Classic <span style="font-style: italic;">or</span> Blogger BETA and, best of all, is one of my easiest hacks to install yet!

Just go to <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/blogger/calendarWidget.php">the setup page</a>.  Enter your feed URL (do NOT use a FeedBurner feed, it tends to mess things up) and your blog title.  Click generate.  Follow the instructions.

Now, if you use mine (click the calendar next to the archives box in my sidebar) you'll note that I have posts in the calendar going all the way back to forever it seems.  Your probably only has this month's.  Well, that is just one extra hack, but there's a catch -- you have to be one of those who posts all blog entries to del.icio.us (I know, the BETA people no longer have a GM for that, I'm working on it.)

Go to the <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/blogger/full_del_rss.php">full del.icio.us feed setup page</a> (I won't steal your password!), enter your del.icio.us username and password in the upper form.  Click Go.  Go back to the setup page.  Enter your username (and optional anchor tag) in the lower form.  Click Go.  Use the contents of your address bar as your feed URL for the calendar instead of your normal feed.
