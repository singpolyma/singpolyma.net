I toot my own horn too much.  This blog has more recently been at least 90% my own code.  My readership seems to be going up though (FeedBurner reporting over 60 as of yesterday).

Either way I think I'll spend this posts talking about some of the more recent developments in the hacker community.  Some of this is new, some of it is old, it is not a comprehensive list.  This is just what I thought was cool recently ;)  These are in no particular order.

<ul><li>...has used the new Blogger 'if' tags (as <a href="http://stubborn-fanatic.blogspot.com/2006/11/only-on-comment-label-search-and.html">he documented them</a>) to create a hack that <a href="http://stubborn-fanatic.blogspot.com/2006/12/adsense-inside-your-post-only-on-post.html">shows Google AdSense ads</a> inside posts on item pages.  My blog is ad-free.  I find ads inside posts the most annoying.  If I ever do ads I promise they will not interfere with the post.  But at least his hack keeps them from cluttering the main page.</li><li>...<a href="http://stubborn-fanatic.blogspot.com/2006/12/add-background-colors-to-comments.html">colourful, colourful comments</a>!</li><li>...<a href="http://stubborn-fanatic.blogspot.com/2006/12/control-your-layout-editors-layout.html">fix your layout editor</a> (you have a hacked-beyond-belief template!)
</li><li>...has created a <a href="http://stubborn-fanatic.blogspot.com/2006/11/recent-post-titles-navigation-menu-auto.html">horizontal menu bar</a> of your tags (yawn...) with drop-down lists of the most recent posts (cool!)  Definately a hack to check out, even if you don't install it.</li></ul><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://hoctro.blogspot.com/">Hoctro</a>
<ul><li>...has a <a href="http://hoctro.blogspot.com/2006/12/killer-hack-contents-by-category.html">wicked table of contents widget</a> for your blog!</li><li>...<a href="http://hoctro.blogspot.com/2006/12/simple-hack-basic-ajax-search-utility.html">Google AJAX</a> using their API instead <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/gajax.php">of YubNub</a>.</li></ul>Note to Hoctro : how about a way to browse your blog by date?  The newest entry on the main page and then no interface for date-based archives or a prevous-post link/list.  Nothing.  Annoying.
