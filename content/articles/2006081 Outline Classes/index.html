The list of <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2006/01/xoxo-developers-resources.html">XOXO Developer's Resources</a> has been updated to include the <a href="http://www.awriterz.org/etcetc/boxtheweb/code/apis/#outlineclasses">Outline Classes</a>.  Written in PHP4 but with compatability built in for PHP5 this set of classes is designed to be able to parse and create XOXO, OPML, hAtom, JSON, and arbitrary XML documents and fragments.  The classes are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>'ed.
