I'm not going to do it anymore.  I'm not going to cross the 73rd day of this year, change my clocks ahead one hour, and give myself an artificial mini-jetlag on purpose.  Nor am I going to just sit around and wish that someone would finally give the axe to DST.  I am going to axe it myself.

You see, DST is really a shift in timezone.  In Ontario, where I live, we are normally on <abbr title="Eastern Standard Time">EST</abbr>, UTC-5.  Then, 8% of the way through the second Sunday in March, everyone jumps ahead 41 millidays to <abbr title="Eastern Daylight Time">EDT</abbr>, UTC-4.  Time in EST doesn't change, but the people of the region choose to live as though they are in a different timezone.

Well, I deal with people from other timezones all the time.  On the Internet I communicate with people from Africa, India, the UK, California, and more.  When I talk about the time I either convert to their timezone, or qualify my statement ("6 my time" or "6 EST").  When they talk about the time, I convert to my local time before writing it down or adding it to my schedule.

So, for this summer twenty-ten, I will be living in a different timezone than many of those physically around me, but so what?  I live in a different timezone than over half of the people I interact with anyway, but that's never been a problem.

Would you consider also ditching DST?  Of all the Calendar/Time reforms I'm a fan of, it seems the most popular.  If enough people just stop respecting it, people will realise just how useless it is. #foobarbaz
