Dear Confused Reader,

You are reading this because much of the Geekery to come out of the Singpolyma - Technical Blog confuses you.  The code is far beyond your comprehension, and sometimes so are the instructions.  You are the one who emails me your template to hack, instead of hacking it yourself.  That's OK, and I'm willing to help, but in case you wanted to try doing a little bit more yourself....

Hoctro, another brilliant hacker, has written a sort of 101 (or is that 411?) post on hacking your blog, or at least following the instructions to do so.  Complete with screenshots illustrating his points, this article will help you understand not only my writings, but those of other Blogger Hackers, forever.

Yours,

Singpolyma
