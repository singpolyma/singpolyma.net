Tired of running from <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/">my blog</a> to <a href="http://blogfresh.blogspot.com/">FreshBlog</a>, to <a href="http://bloggeratto.blogspot.com/">Bloggeratto</a>, to <a href="http://hoctro.blogspot.com/">Hoctro</a>, to <a href="http://beautifulbeta.blogspot.com/">Beautiful Beta</a>, to <a href="http://hackosphere.blogspot.com/">Hackosphere</a>, to <a href="http://purplemoggy.blogspot.com/">PurpleMoggy</a>, to others trying to find hacks?  Enter the <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/">Blogger Hacks Wiki</a>.  <a href="http://blogfresh.blogspot.com/2006/06/bloggerhacks-wiki.html">Launched back in June</a> with the collaboration of many hackers and bloggers, this Wiki is meant to be the Wikipedia of Blogger Hacks.  Not all of the newest hacks are there, but the general available ones should be.

Since the Blogger BETA (now the new Blogger) launch, the wiki has been stagnating just a little bit.  Hacks have been rolling out at record rate from many new players.  I myself have been very lax at entering all my new hacks into the Wiki.  One problem was that one could not tell from the wiki if a hack was for the old or new Blogger.

No longer.  The main 'View Hacks' link now points to the <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/Category:New_Blogger">Wiki Category for the New Blogger</a>, and I have added categories to all the hacks' pages based on platform.  We as hackers need to start adding our hacks back into this database -- everyone will benefit, even us!  (Who wants to duplicate work if there's an easy way to find out someone else already did it?)  There is also a category for hacks which I was unsure what platforms they would work on.  I need help going through and recategorising the pages in the <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/Category:Platform_Unknown">Platform Unknown</a> category.

I have also done some work on the <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/Request_Hacks">Request Hacks</a> page.  New hack requests should now be added to the top section 'Undiscussed Requests'.  After the community has posted some feedback it gets moved to under the 'Discussed Requests' heading.  Requests which have been solved (ie, had hacks created for them) move to the <a href="http://www.editthis.info/bloggerhacks/Request_Hacks/Solved">Solved Requests</a> page.

The Wiki benefits both hackers (easier to find our hacks, find other's hacks, and get ideas for hacks from the requests page) and the general people (find hacks so much easier!)  I would really like to keep it up-to-date and maintained :)
