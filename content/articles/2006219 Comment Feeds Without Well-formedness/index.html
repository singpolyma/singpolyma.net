In response to the popular confusion about <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/04/importance-of-xml-well-formedness.html">XML well-formedness</a> and a <a href="http://blogfresh.blogspot.com/2006/07/sidebar-comments-and-hearsay.html#c115452427970473319">recent nudgeing by Greg</a>, I have upgraded <a href="http://bloggercomments.ning.com/">Blogger Recent Comments</a>.  People who have been there before will note that there is now one less <a href="http://bloggercomments.ning.com/instructions.php">instruction</a> -- XML well-formedness is no longer necessary!  I have tested this with a Blogger template on which I purposely broke well-formedness and the comments still came through fine!  Originally introduced <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2005/12/blogger-comment-syndication-service.html">on this blog</a>, Blogger Recent Comments is a <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> app that can automatially generate RSS, JavaScript, and JSON feeds of all comments on your blog.  Setup is now just three easy steps!
