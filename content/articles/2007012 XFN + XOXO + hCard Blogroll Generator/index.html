What's that?  Your blog platform doesn't support <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a>?  You want more <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo">XOXO</a>-centric markup on your blogroll?  You want your friends marked up as <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCards</a> in the blogroll?  Now you can!

<a href="http://xoxotools.ning.com/xfn-xoxo-blogroll.html">This generator tool</a> is based on the original <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/creator">XFN Creator</a> and generates code for a full XOXO blogroll with XFN relationships and hCard nodes.
