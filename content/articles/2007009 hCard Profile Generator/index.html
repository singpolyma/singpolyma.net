What is the point of getting that profile section in your sidebar marked up as an <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>?  There are a number of reasons.  Your blog will be compatible with the features of the new <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4106/">Operator Firefox Extension</a>.  If you ping <a href="http://pingerati.net/">Pingerati</a> (or you're indexed by <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a>), people will be able to find you on the <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/">hCard Search Engine</a>.  There are, obviously, other reasons as well.

What's that?  Blogger doesn't output this markup by default, and you don't want to learn the codes?  No problem!  Use my new <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/blogger/hcard_profile_wizard.php">hCard Profile Wizard</a> and follow the easy two-step process to include an hCard-compatible profile in your blog!
