The <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2006/01/xoxo-blog-format.html">XOXO Blog Format</a> has been updated to be compatible with <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom 0.1</a>.  The <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2006/01/xoxo-blog-templates.html">Basic Blogger Template</a> and the template for this blog have also been updated.  Please note that the new template is not quite valid hAtom, since the 'updated' field is just your Blogger post timestamp format and not proper <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/datetime-design-pattern">datetime-design-pattern</a>.  This will be fixed as soon as a way to output properly-formatted dates from a Blogger blog is found or the hAtom spec is changed.  All applicable <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2006/01/xoxo-data-tools.html">XOXO Data Tools</a> either have been updated or will be updated shortly.
