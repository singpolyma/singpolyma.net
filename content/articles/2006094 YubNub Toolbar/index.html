If you hadn't heard of <a href="http://yubnub.org/">YubNub</a> before, now you have.  The basic concept is easy to grasp -- typing "g test" takes you to a goole search for 'test' and "wink test" takes you to a wink search for test, etc.  Although much more powerful than search engines, that's a good place to start.

If you send YubNub a raw URL it will take you there without processing.  This enables one to use YubNub as your location bar directly.  Problems with this approach have been that the search box in firefox (where YubNub has traditionally resided for FF users) is very small and does not update on page load.

Solution?  Write a new FireFox extension to replace the location bar with YubNub.  Done.  This is my first ever FireFox extension, so it may be a bit quirky.  I'd appreciate feedback and bug reports, but cannot guarentee I can do anything about it, since my XUL etc knowledge is very limited at this point.
