I discovered a new-to-me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splog">Splog</a> format today.  See <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=singpolyma&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;scoring=d">these search results</a>?  See the acne scar removal articles?  These Splogs are rel=nofollow linking to me with my name in order to make their SPAM show up in other's search results... that's low...
