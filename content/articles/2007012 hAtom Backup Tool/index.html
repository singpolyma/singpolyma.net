<a href="http://xoxotools.ning.com/backup.php">This backup tool</a> will crawl your blog for <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom</a> or <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2006/01/xoxo-blogroll-format.html">XOXO Blog Format</a> content and put it all together in one file that you can save to your hard drive for backup purposes.

If you do not use the New Blogger you will have to have an archive list in your sidebar that has the class <span style="font-weight: bold;">archive-list</span> on it.  With the New Blogger if you have an archive widget it should just work.
