I have change my blog over to a new template! This template is much more efficient with screen space, easier to read, and <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2006/01/xoxo-blog-format.html">XOXO Blog Format</a> compatible. For now this means that I do not have to have a separate code snippet to generate my comments feed, but some other services are in the works, including a script to generate better feeds (ie, ones that include the <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/default.aspx?content=archive.htm#exposingRssComments" rel="nofollow">wfw:commentRss</a> tag).

This post is also the first one I am trying from <a href="http://performancing.com/">Performancing for Firefox</a>. It seems really nice, and is definately more conveniant. The only things I wish it would do are (1) link to my del.icio.us account, instead of to technorati (2) support multiple del.icio.us accounts for adding posts from different blogs to different accounts (3) support stuffing the first 255 characters of a post into the del.icio.us account.
