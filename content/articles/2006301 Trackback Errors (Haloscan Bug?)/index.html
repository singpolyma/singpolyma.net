Many users of <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/07/blogger-delicious-categorising-pinging.html">my trackback script</a>, including myself, have complained of odd errors.  Awhile back, I upgraded the script to give better error messages.  On pinging a <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/">haloscan</a> trackback addresses (which we on Blogger mostly are) I get:

Error #11 : Problem saving. Please contact Haloscan

I have posted it in the appropriate thread of the <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=5691&amp;amp;view=findpost&amp;amp;p=25212">Haloscan forums</a>, but that seems to be a thread where we report bugs and get no reply.  I have not changed the trackback code from what was previously working, and I cannot seem to find any problems with it.  Nor do I find any documentation on this error.

So basically, this is a '<a href="http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/2006/08/no-useful-search-results-post-blog.html#c115726468378278090">Googleseeding</a>' post to see if anyone else has any bright ideas.
