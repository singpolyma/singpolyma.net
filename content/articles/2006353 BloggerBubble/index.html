<a href="http://andufo.com/">Andr√©s Santos</a> wrote <a href="http://andufo.com/proyectos/bloggerbubble">a nice hack for Blogger</a> that used <a href="http://www.websnapr.com/">Websnapr</a> to display pop-up thumbnails of links in your blog posts.  Just install one line of code and you're good to go.

Problem : It didn't work with my Blogger template.

And so I did what I often do -- hacked his hack!  If his code won't work for you, insert this code just before the &lt;/head&gt; tag in your template instead:
<code>
&lt;script src="http://jscripts.ning.com/get.php?xn_auth=no&amp;amp;id=2654582" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
This should work with most Blogger templates (write me if it won't with yours and I'll update it).  Also, it will work with any <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom</a>-based template.
