After much trouble and headaches with the speed of the <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> backend, the <a href="http://comment.ning.com/import.php">Commentosphere Delicious Importer</a> is working! Numerous recent updates and optimizations to Ning seem to have greatly increased the speed of the backend, which was what was dragging down the original.  I created a test app clone of Commentosphere and successfully imported 70 comments from some test data <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/">Johan</a> sent me awhile back to make sure that it really was working this time.

There is also now a <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/2538">Greasemonkey userscript</a> for posting to Commentosphere!  Based off of <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/2150">Johan's commentblogging userscript</a>, it adds a link to all comment post pages on Blogger blogs that links to the Add a Comment form on Commentosphere, already filled in with the necessary information for your new comment.  One thing I would like to add to the script is the ability to select parent comments from the comment page, instead of having to get that data manually if you want it.  It is still recommended to run with both the userscript <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> the bookmarklet -- for posting comments from non-Blogger blogs.
