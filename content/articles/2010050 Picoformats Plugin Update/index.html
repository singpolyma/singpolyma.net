I've made some large updates to my <a href="<%= @items['/articles/2008126 Picoformats for Wordpress/index.html'].path %>">picoformats plugin for WordPress</a> (picoformats also sometimes known as microsyntax).

<ul>
<li>Processing of comments has been removed (at least for now)</li>
<li>Both trackbacks <strong>and</strong> pingbacks are sent for @ replies</li>
<li>Trackbacks and pingbacks are sent for URLs in in-reply-to custom fields.</li>
<li>URLs are auto-linked</li>
<li>More stable regex, etc for @ reply/hashtag detection with some help from @tantek.com</li>
<li>support for starting a post's content with "<kbd>reply URL</kbd>", "<kbd>reply #URL</kbd>", "<kbd>#URL</kbd>", "<kbd>reply post-ID</kbd>", "<kbd>reply #post-ID</kbd>", or "<kbd>#post-ID</kbd>" and having in-reply-to custom field added automatically (and the reply bit at the beginning of the content snipped off).
</li></ul>
