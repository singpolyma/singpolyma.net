I have updated my <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/04/yubnub-locationbar.html">YubNub LocationBar FireFox Extension</a>.  There was a minor glitch that caused typing local IPs (for router setup, etc) to be interpreted as YubNub commands.  This has been fixed.  I have also added a new feature.  If you have any FireFox keyword 'quick search' bookmarks defined, these now work, and are considered a higher precedence than YubNub commands.  Thus if you have a FireFox keyword bookmark defined for 'g' that does something other than Google search, that will be done when you type 'g blah' instead of using YubNub's command.
