<b title="Updated 2011-08-06">JoongSeob Vito Kim <a href="/ipns/singpolyma.net/2006/12/peek-boo-and-scrolling/#comment-158877">has created</a> a <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/108908">version of this script</a> that works with the new blogger post editor.</b>

<b title="Updated 2007-01-10">I have made some minor bug fixes to this script, as well as made it so that it saves the trackback URLs when you save a draft.</b>

Some time ago I married Johan's del.icio.us and pinging script with my own trackback script into <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/07/blogger-delicious-categorising-pinging.html">one new script</a>.  That script does not work on the new version of Blogger, and the trackback feature has been glitchy for some time.  Outgoing trackback is still something we need on the new version of Blogger, and the pinging services provided by this script might even be useful on other blogging services.  Del.icio.us posting?  Now that we have labels?  Well, <a href="http://ghill.customer.netspace.net.au/freshtags/">Freshtags</a>, <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/12/blogger-calendar.html">my calendar widget</a>, and just tag management in general, will work better if you use del.icio.us.  If you disagree, this part of the script is optional.

This script does not overwrite the old script.  Running both simultaneously will look dumb on the Blogger Classic interface (there will be duplication), but will not break anything.  If you only run on the new Blogger, please remove the old script (if you have it installed).
