I now have eight variations of my <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/11/peek-boo-link-lists.html">original peek-a-boo widget</a>.  (See also <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/12/peek-boo-html-widgets.html">peek-a-boo HTML</a> and <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/12/peek-boo-and-scrolling.html">peek-a-boo scrolling</a>.)  I was then asked for <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/12/peek-boo-and-scrolling.html#c116782793901753979">yet another variant</a>.  I realised that keeping these strictly in posts is insane and disorganised.  So I have added the variant (open links in new window) and created a wizard.  Just follow the steps and generate the code for your widget, just the way you like it!
