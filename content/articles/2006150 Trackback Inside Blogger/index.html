<b title="Update 2006-10-28">It is reccomended that you use the new <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/07/blogger-delicious-categorising-pinging.html">del.icio.us, pinging, AND trackback script</a>.  This one may still work, but I no longer actively support it.</b>

Blogger has no native trackback capabilities.  While trackback is a wonderful tool, it can sometimes just be too much of a pain for Blogger users.  After all, you just went to the work of writing a wonderful post, who wants to bother making a hop over to Haloscan afterwards to send trackbacks to others?  With the advent of the semi-automatic Backlinks we seem to be ever less inclined to make the extra hop.

Now, the extra hop can be a thing of the past.  Install the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/4148.user.js">Blogger Trackback Userscript</a> and get trackback functionality directly from your Blogger dashboard!  Every time you publish a post, the script harvests the title, permalink, and post excerpt (as well as blog title) and then displays a form on the 'post complete' page for trackbacks.  Enter the trackback URLs one at a time and hit enter.  The trackbacks will be completed AJAXially.

Much thanks to Johan's <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2005/11/blogger-publish-ping-and-categorizer.html">Blogger del.icio.us helper</a> script which facilitated much of the code for this script.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Future Features</span>
<ol><li>Support for autodiscovery trackback RDF so that one can enter simply the post URL for a trackback and not have to use the full trackback URL</li><li>Optionally try auto-trackbacking to all posts linked to from the post</li></ol>
