You know what you want from your blogging service.  If you use Blogger, you may have written a '<a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/03/beef-up-blogger.html">Beef up Blogger</a>'-style post, even.  Or a Beef up WordPress post.  Or maybe even a Beef up Xanga post (yes, there are some real bloggers on Xanga).  I at one point even had a <a href="http://www.awriterz.org/etcetc/BloggingReviews/ratingBreakdown.php">rating breakdown</a> to see how well blogging services matched up to my ideal!  While my opinions have changed over time, one thing still remains - no service is perfect.  No matter what you use there are things you wish your service could do.  That's why we <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> blog hacks!

This post is a survey.  What <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> the perfect blogging service?  We're all going to answer differently, but hopefully some patterns will emerge.  What features are important?  Forget for a moment what is supported by your particular platform and just tell us what you want.  Not what you wish you had, but what you want even if you have it.  Trackback can be important to you even if you use WordPress.  Maybe that's <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> you're using WordPress.

The purpose of this survey is not to determine one particular existing service that is the 'perfect blogging service', but rather to identify the feature set that is important to bloggers.

You can respond to this survey by leaving a comment on this post (probably preferred) or by writing a post on your blog and linking back here.  I don't trust blog search or backlinks, so I'd really appreciate trackback pings if you decide on the latter, or a comment with a link to your post.
