I have released version 0.15 of my <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/04/yubnub-locationbar.html">YubNub LocationBar Firefox Extension</a>.  There are some minor changes to the look and feel (the location bar shows the YubNub URL and icon while processing, and the YubNub icon shows on blank pages).  It also extends the local firefox keyword bookmarks to allow for switches.  If switches are added to the bookmark's URL (using YubNub ${name} syntax), then the bookmark will accept switches according to normal YubNub syntax.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span>  I forgot to mention -- it also stores up to 50 commands from your command history between sessions now.
