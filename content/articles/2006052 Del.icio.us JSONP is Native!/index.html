For quite awhile now, del.icio.us has offered JSON support, but not a proper <a href="http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2006/01/jsonp-why-how.html">JSONP</a> implementation.  I even <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/01/delicious-json-with-callback.html">wrote my own proxying script</a> to fix this oversight.  It seems that that will no longer be necessary.  If you pass callback=CALLBACK to a del.icio.us JSON feed it will now output proper JSONP that does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> set the Delicious.posts variable (easy to fix in your callback function) but calls CALLBACK with the JSON object as a parameter.  Compare these:
<a href="http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/singpolyma.techblog/">http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/singpolyma.techblog/</a>
<a href="http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/singpolyma.techblog/?callback=CALLBACK">http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/singpolyma.techblog/?callback=CALLBACK</a>
There has, as yet, been no official announcement on the del.icio.us blog, so this feature may yet be pulled like <a href="http://blogfresh.blogspot.com/2006/01/delicious-now-with-bit-of-after-taste.html">some others have</a>, but I hope they will not.  Hopefully I will soon be modifying <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2005/11/in-blog-tag-viewing.html">my version of FreshTags</a> to make good use of this native JSONP support.
