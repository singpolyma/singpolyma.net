Yes, I know, another post on a Ning app of mine.  <a href="http://wrinks.ning.com/">Wrinks</a> is an app for the creation/management of webrings, blogrings, linkrolls, and blogrolls.  Ring/roll creators have full power over what sites are members of their wrink and wrinks can be embedded in web pages using either JavaScript or PHP (depending on your hosting situation) as either webrings or blogrolls.  The service aims at being a sort of 'social blogrolling' system.  The first person to add a site to the system has control over that site's metadata (title, description, feedurl, etc.).

Traffic data is stored for each Wrink and wrinks can be browsed by tag, sorted by traffic number.  These lists of wrinks can be syndicated via either RSS 2.0 or JSON(P).  Each wrink can also be retreived via JSON(P) for custom inclusion in webpages.

Wrink rolls can also be filtered by tag.  Each site on a roll has tags, and if &amp;tag= is passed to the wrink, only sites matching that tag (or tag intersection) are returned.  This opens the way for the possibility of filtering blogrolls by tag.
