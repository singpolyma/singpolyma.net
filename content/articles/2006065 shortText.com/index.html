<a href="http://www.shorttext.com/">shortText.com</a> is a site with an interesting purpose -- to post any text.  Plain text only (which is nice for posting code) this site seems free and unlimited.  Just enter your text in the box and click the button.  A (rather random) URL is generated as a permalink to your content (<a href="http://www.shorttext.com/dgic">example</a>) and then you can send that URL to anyone.  For those of use who run blog(s) this isn't all that useful -- after all, most content we want to post should make sense on <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> of our blogs, but it could be very useful to people who just want a one-time (or a few-time) publishing of something quickly and don't want to bother with an account registration process.
