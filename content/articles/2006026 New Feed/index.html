No, my feed has not moved.  It is still at feedburner in the same place.  What is different is what it supports.  I am now generating my feed direct from my template to RSS 2.0 using my new <a href="http://xoxotools.ning.com/hatom2rss.php">hAtom2RSS</a> converter.  This script supports both <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2006/01/xoxo-blog-format.html">XOXO Blog Format</a> <i>and</i> <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom</a> templates, including all extensions to hAtom described by the XOXO Blog Format.  It outputs the comments, <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/default.aspx?content=archive.htm#exposingRssComments">wfw:commentFeed</a>, and <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/">slash:comments</a> tags when the appropriate data is provided in the page.  While this doesn't do much that is visible in most current readers, what it <i>does</i> do is make the 'comment count' option for FeedFlare work.  So I now have comment counts being displayed in my feed from a Blogger blog!  I highly reccomend that anyone using the hAtom2RSS converter pair it with <a href="http://feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>, if for no other reason than speed.  The script polls your home page every time it is accessed, so having FeedBurner cache the feed will definately provide a performance boost.
