<a href="http://xoxotools.ning.com/stdRSS.php">Standard RSS</a> is a tool which takes any RSS, ATOM, hAtom, or XOXO Blog Format feed and turns it into a standard RSS 2.0 core.  More information is available on the tool's home page.  There is also a <a href="http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=stdRSS">YubNub command</a> to go with it.
