<a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>'s feeds are not the most useful in the world.  They are sorted by edit date instead of when they're happening, and they're only available in ATOM.

No longer.  Using the extended feed information Google tacks into their calendar feed it is possible to create a clean, sorted feed with the start date as the pubDate.  Just go to the <a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/googlecalendar.php">Google Calendar Feed Cleaner</a> and enter the URL to your calendar's feed, select the format you want (XHTML for testing, RSS 2.0, or JSON(P) ), and enter the max items to be in the results (default 5).  You will get a nice, clean feed of your Google Calendar data.
