A reading list is the organised list of all <a href="http://whatisrss.com/">feeds</a> that a person reads using their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_reader">feed reader</a>.  There are two primary file formats for reading lists, XOXO and OPML (see <a href="http://blogxoxo.blogspot.com/2005/12/what-is-xoxo.html">What is XOXO?</a>).  Reading lists are popularly used as an import/export format for moving subscriptions between feed readers.  If they are made available online they can also be used as dynamic reading lists.

Dynamic reading lists are reading lists that are aggregated by a feed reader.  One folder or module is always updated to contain the most current subscriptions from the reading list.  This allows users to subscribe to other users' reading lists to see what other's are reading, for example.  Directory sites like <a href="http://share.opml.org/" rel="nofollow" rev="vote-against">Share Your OPML</a> (which, as the name indicates, is anti-XOXO) also allow users to share their subscriptions <span style="font-style: italic;">en masse</span>.

Feed readers currently supporting the dynamic reading list concept are:
<ul><li><a href="http://blogbridge.com/">BlogBridge</a></li><li><a href="http://boxtheweb.4x2.net/">BoxtheWeb</a></li></ul>Dynamic reading lists can be previewed or included as a widget in a webpage using <a href="http://grazr.com/">Grazr</a>.  Grazr currently only supports OPML, but XOXO is on the todo list.
