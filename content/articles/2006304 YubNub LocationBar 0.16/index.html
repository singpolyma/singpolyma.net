Version 0.16 of my <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/04/yubnub-locationbar.html">YubNub LocationBar Firefox Extension</a> has been released.  There is now support for non-standard URLs (such as those from <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/whoNicDOffWithTheYummyJunkDomains.html">nic.d</a>.  Arrow-key history navigation broke some default Firefox features, so it is now Ctrl+Arrow Key.  A hackish integration with Firefox auto-complete history has also been coded.  Type y: before a command to have the auto-complete work (or just to force it into YubNub mode).
