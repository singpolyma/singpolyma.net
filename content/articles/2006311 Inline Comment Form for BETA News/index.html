If there is one hack I get requests for more than any other it is this.  My inline comments form on Blogger BETA.  It was my first ever hack (before I had even fully moved to Blogger), and probably still my favourite as the most useful.  I recently <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/10/regarding-inline-comment-forms-and.html">blogged somewhat optimistically</a> about my progress, which only increased the demands.  I regret to inform you that I have hit a wall.  Perhaps not unsurmountable, but a huge one.

The security token scraping did not work.

I'm not entirely surprised.  After all, Blogger added the security token code to prevent people from doing just what I am attempting.  I cannot say that I fully understand how the whole technology works, or why my attempts to circumvent it have failed, I only know that they have.  It may take help from Blogger themselves (bah!) to get this working.

For the community : to those who wish to put their heads with mine on this problem.  The code for this hack on BETA, such as it is for as far as I've got, can be found at the following URLs:

As a side note : installing this hack as is actually does sort of work.  But it errors every time and requires that the user push the button on the inline form, and then on the other form.  (Similar to what is happening here since I was forced by mega-spammers to turn on word verification...)
