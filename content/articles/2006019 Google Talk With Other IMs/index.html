<a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> has been <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/open-federation-for-google-talk.html">opened to communicate</a> with other XMPP IM services!  One of the complaints against it when it first launched was that it used the open XMPP protocol, but was a closed system.  No longer.  This is a smart, and a useful, move for them.  Hopefully they'll add MSN/AIM/ICQ integration eventaully as well...
