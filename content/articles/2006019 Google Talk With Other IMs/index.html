<a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> has been <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/open-federation-for-google-talk.html">opened to communicate</a> with other XMPP IM services!  One of the complaints against it when it first launched was that it used the open XMPP protocol, but was a closed system.  No longer.  This is a smart, and a useful, move for them.  Hopefully they'll add MSN/AIM/ICQ integration eventaully as well... <div class="tags">Tags:<ul><li><a href="http://del.icio.us/singpolyma.techblog/google" rel="tag">google</a></li> <li><a href="http://del.icio.us/singpolyma.techblog/talk" rel="tag">talk</a></li> <li><a href="http://del.icio.us/singpolyma.techblog/im" rel="tag">im</a></li> </ul></div>
