Google is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch?m=599">launching</a> inline chatting for Gmail in the near future.  There is already an option in your Gmail settings (or at least in mine, it seems to be coming online account-by-account) to save all your <a href="http://talk.google.com/">Google Talk</a> chat logs into a section of your Gmail account called 'chats', to be searchable just like your email.  There is also an <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/chat.html">information page</a> stating that they plan to include the ability to chat directly from your Gmail screen (a la <a href="http://www.meebo.com/">Meebo</a> and others).  This should prove interesting.
