For the longest time Blogger has been ATOM-only.  This now seems to be a thing of the past.  While I can find no official announcement anywhere, RSS 2.0 feeds seem to now be available on all Blogger blogs (unless the blog has not had the index published since whenever the change was).  As you would expect, while the old was, say:

<a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/atom.xml">http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/atom.xml</a>

They have added to this:

<a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/rss.xml">http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/rss.xml</a>

It's not the nicest implementation of RSS 2.0 I've seen, and I'm going to keep using my hAtom2RSS-through-feedburner feed for the comment options, but this is definately a step forward for Blogger.
