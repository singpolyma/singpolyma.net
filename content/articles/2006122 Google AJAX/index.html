<a href="http://singpolymaplay.ning.com/gajax.php">Google AJAX</a> is an interface for Google search that allows you to get the search results AJAX-style.  This can be really handy when doing a series of quick searches.  Better yet, however, is the widget that comes with it.  Simply cut-and-paste the given code into your blog sidebar and you have inline Google search power -- the results are displayed right in your sidebar!  You can also (optionally) specify a URL to restrict the search to, thus creating a widget to do an AJAX-style search on your own site using the power of Google right from your sidebar!  You can see an example of this in my own sidebar.  The script is built using the power of <a href="http://yubnub.org/">YubNub</a>.
