I have updated my <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/01/new-inline-comments-form.html">inline comments form hack</a> to be compatible with <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a>.  Note that if you have the comments forms visible on your main and archive pages like I do there will still be a problem there, but on item pages the values will be filled it and the coComment detector automatically invoked.
