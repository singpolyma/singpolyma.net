<a href="http://jscripts.ning.com/">JScripts</a> is a new <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> app of mine for hosting JavaScript includes.  The benefits of a semi-centralised location for hosting JavaScript APIs/hacks (from the <a href="http://ghill.customer.netspace.net.au/freshtags/">FreshTags</a> system to the prototype framework) are many, but the greatest ones are (1) it makes it easier for us to find ones others have written (2) browsers can then cache the same JavaScript for use across sites.  I have put <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/02/freshtags-singpolyma.html">my FreshTags system</a> <a href="http://jscripts.ning.com/view.php?id=818185">on the app</a>, but will also keep it hosted in the other location for now.  This blog now includes the file hosted on JScripts, however.

JScripts (and its parent app, <a href="http://filess.ning.com/">FileSS</a>, which I also wrote) has a <a href="http://cocomment.com/">coComment</a>-integrated comment system and also integrates features from <a href="http://sweeties.ning.com/">Sweeties</a>.  There are RSS feeds for new scripts (which can be filtered by tag, user, and search query) and for comments on each script.
