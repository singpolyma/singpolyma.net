<a href="http://ww2.yurnet.com:8080/">Yurnet</a> is a search engine with an interesting model -- search for things instead of in places.  If you want to search for DVDs, but don't know what engine to use to do that, you could search Google for an appropriate engine, then search that engine, or just go to Yurnet and pick 'dvd'.

Yurnet takes awhile to get your head around.  That's because at first it looks like a cheesy metasearch engine.  If you're still thinking search <span style="font-style: italic;">where</span> it seems almost rediculous.  Which is faster : going to Google Images and searching for what you want or going to Yurnet, picking Google Images, and searching?  The answer is they're basically the same.  After corrospondence back and forth to the site creator, however, I finally came to understand that the real point of Yurnet is search <span style="font-style: italic;">what</span> for when you don't <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> what site to search.

That said, the site is rather ugly.  The final resolved URL is http://ww2.yurnet.com:8080/ -- not exactly something that looks pretty in bookmarks.  The drop-down select box is a mélange of capitalization schemes, and the 'vs' searches (which really are out of the scope of the site) are listed first, giving an initial illusion that alphabetical order is not preserved.  Also, some things are listed as <span style="font-style: italic;">where</span>s still (ie Google Image).  Realistically the box should be cleaned up to use the same capitalization schemes throughout and be <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> a list of <span style="font-style: italic;">what</span>s in alphabetical order, without engine names and the like getting in the way.
