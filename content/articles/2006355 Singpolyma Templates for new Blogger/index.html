Now having translated most of my hacks to the new Blogger, it is time to unveil the templates.  I myself will likely be switching soon, and my template will be based on the code here published.  The features are similar to the <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/06/singpolyma-templates.html">first set</a>, but optomised for the new Blogger.

To install one of these templates, just cut-n-paste the code into the 'Edit HTML' section of your blog and save.  Confirm deletion of widgets (Yes, unfortunately, you lose you widgets.  You can make them again).
