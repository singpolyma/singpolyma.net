Most of us are aware of the problem.  If I tag this post 'web2.0' and you monitor Technorati for the tag 'web20' then we're sunk.  You'll never find me.  If I tag a webpage on del.icio.us as 'hacks' and you monitor the page for 'hack', you may never see it.  These tags are <a href="http://tagging.ning.com/about.php#synonymous">virtually synonymous</a>, but a computer can't tell that.

Enter <a href="http://tagging.ning.com/">Tagging</a>, a new <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning </a>app designed to solve this very problem.  The app stores groups of virtually synonymous tags (or <a href="http://tagging.ning.com/about.php#taggroups">TagGroups</a>) that are defined by the community and provides easy access to them via both XOXO and JSON(P) APIs.  With space to clearly define and describe TagGroups and a <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a> <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/teamblog/?p=63">catch-all </a>discussion system the community solves their own problem by defining for the system what tags mean the same thing.
