Blogger BETA has launched and with it comes many new features and challenges for us as hackers.  I'm slow on the draw for this one.  I was on a trip when the whole thing came down and am just now catching up.  FreshBlog, as always, has <a href="http://blogfresh.blogspot.com/2006/08/significant-blogger-upgrade.html">the scoop extrordinaire</a>.  Much good stuff over there... I wish they had some sort of 'blogger-beta' tag for all of it (or tagged it all both blogger and beta) so I could link to the category list (hint, hint ;) ).

I'm not going to give a rundown of all the new stuff, but instead am going to give a 'so what' as relates to my stuff.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Busted Hacks</span>
I'm going to be creating a test Blogger BETA account soon and trying to fix up hacks that don't work there.  However, from what I'm hearing it seems that there is no HTML editing in the new template system, and I don't want to spend work making the old hacks work on the old template system for the new Blogger (that's a mouthful!).  I'd rather wait until hacks can be implemented in their own right on the new system.  More on this when something happens.

Is dead.  Full stop.  No question there.  Blogger BETA has comment feeds.  I will keep the app running, however, for people who have not upgraded yet (like me!) and just for reference.

<a href="http://ghill.customer.netspace.net.au/freshtags/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FreshTags</span></a>
Both the main FreshTags and <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/02/freshtags-singpolyma.html">my version</a> are far from dead.  Just as <a href="http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/03/freshtags-for-wordpress.html">FreshTags features are useful on WordPress</a>, where there was already a category system, so they will continue to live on here on Blogger.  Since it's not my baby, I won't say too much, but we are certainly discussing the best way to move forward in this area.  For now, I have upgraded my version to support incoming ?labels= from other blogs, and also to use that locally (still supporting ?tags= from old FreshTags and FreshTags for WordPress).  If you are on Blogger BETA and want to use FreshTags 'as is' (provided you can get the script to work...) the following code will use the proper label display page instead of the 'fake post' for post display:

<span style="font-family:courier new;">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;var freshtags_tag_url = "/search";&lt;/script&gt;</span>

Upgrades to the Greasemonkey script should also be forthcoming.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>
Have created a <a href="http://singpolyma-beta.blogspot.com/index.html">BETA test blog </a>and I have a mixed reaction.  The new templates interface is nice, and as long as they get HTML editing working for it, it should be Ã¼ber cool.  Some of the new button graphics are uglier, and the post published page doesn't seem to have the details on it anymore (because of the dynamism), which will cause problems for the GM world...  the JS/XHTML module funcitonality is nice though -- hacks will make use of that!  (perhaps even FT?)
